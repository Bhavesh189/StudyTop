StudyTop - E-Learning Platform
StudyTop is a comprehensive, full-stack e-learning platform designed to provide high-quality educational content, track student progress, and issue verifiable certificates. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a seamless experience for both students and administrators.

Project Overview
The platform allows users to register, browse a catalog of courses, stream video lectures, and track their learning history. Upon completion, students can request certificates, which administrators can generate and issue. The system includes a robust verification tool for employers or third parties to validate the authenticity of the issued certificates.

Installation and Local Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your local machine

Git installed on your local machine

1. Clone the Repository
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/studytop.git
cd studytop
2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

Bash
npm run dev
3. Backend Setup
Ensure your backend server is running locally or update the API endpoint references in the frontend code to point to your live backend (e.g., https://studytop-backend.onrender.com).

If running the backend locally:

Bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
Environment Variables
For security and configuration, create a .env file in your project root and add the following required variables (ensure you adapt these based on your specific backend setup):

Code snippet
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
VITE_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
(Note: In the current implementation, API URLs and tokens are hardcoded. It is highly recommended to migrate them to environment variables before deploying to production.)
